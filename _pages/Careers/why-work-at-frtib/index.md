FRTIB is equally dedicated to attracting as well as retaining a workforce of talented high performing staff that is inclusive and reflective of our participants.

### Flexible Work:  
FRTIB offers multiple work schedule options and up to three (3) day per week Telework. Flexible schedules allow our employees the option to work on a schedule to balance employee and agency needs. IT support and resources enable collaboration with your team inside and outside of the office.
